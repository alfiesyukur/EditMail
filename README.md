##Setup

You need any IDE which supports the gradle build system. While development I used the [Android
Studio][as]. You also need to install the [JDK (Java Development Kit)][jdk].

##Dependencies

 - UiWorker is used for UI related updates.
 - LazyWorker is used for checking the email addresses delayed.
 - Minimal Android version 2.2

##Used third party libs

A sample implementation and a demo app will follow soon.
